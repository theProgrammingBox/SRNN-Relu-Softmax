# SRNN-Relu-Softmax

##A Simple RNN that should overcome the diminishing gradient problem.

It is a RNN except the memory is "external" and altered by the network, like a GNN or lstm, but simplified. This current version uses leaky relu and softmax in anticipation for unsupervised learning implementation.
